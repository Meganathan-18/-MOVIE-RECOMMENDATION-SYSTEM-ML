A Movie Recommendation System is designed to suggest movies to users based on their preferences or previous interactions. In this project, machine learning techniques are implemented on Google Colab to develop an efficient recommendation engine. Using collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, or a hybrid approach, the system analyzes movie features, user ratings, and other factors to personalize recommendations. Google Colab provides an ideal environment for processing large datasets, as it allows for easy integration of libraries like Scikit-Learn, Pandas, and TensorFlow, with the benefit of free GPU support to optimize training and performance.
